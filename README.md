# 558 Final Project - Creating a Shiny App - CDC Respiratory Illness Dashboard   

*  Brief description of the app and its purpose.  
This app will allow users to explore up-to-date information about covid, influenza and pneumonia deaths using the CDC's API. 


*  A list of packages needed to run the app.  
    +  shiny  
    +  shinydashboard  
    +  jsonlite  

*  A line of code that would install all the packages used (so we can easily grab that and run it prior to running your app).  



*  The shiny::runGitHub() code that we can copy and paste into RStudio to run your app.  

shiny::runGitHub("<558_Final_Project>", "<kebreeze>")
